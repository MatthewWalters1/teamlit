Project Description:

  Our project will be some sort of space like game, whether it's more similar to Space Invaders or closer to Asteroids, the objective is still subject to change. Currently, it is just a space ship that you can move around, doing your best to avoid enemies that spawn at the top of the screen. 

Instructions for Use:

* Our project doens't currently use any special repos or libraries other than those included in python(sys, random, etc.) and PyQt6
* Our project runs from main.py(command line: "python3 main.py")
* To move the player: use the arrow keys
* To shoot, press the space bar (right now, there is nothing to shoot at, but you are welcome to shoot anyway)

Notes:

* The game windows and widgets appear differently on Mac and Windows, and currently the printed timer does not show on Mac at all.
