Project Description:

  Our project is a space-like game similar to Space Invaders or Asteroids, and the objective is to survive as long as possible while shooting the enemy ships.

Instructions for Use:

* To install the necessary libraries, run "pip install google-auth", "pip install google-cloud-firestore", and "pip install playsound==1.2.2"
* Our project runs from main.py(command line: "python3 main.py")
* To move the player: use the arrow keys
* To shoot, press the space bar

Notes:

* The game windows and widgets appear differently on Mac and Windows, and currently the printed timer does not show on Mac at all.
